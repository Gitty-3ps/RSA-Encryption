- **Public key access**: : Anyone can access the public key.
- **Private key knowledge**: Only the key pair creator knows the private key.
- **Authentication**: RSA provides public and private keys for message encryption and user authentication.
- **Data transmission security:**: RSA is safe for exchanging data over the internet.
